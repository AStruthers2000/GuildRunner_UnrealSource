# Adventurer Guild Manager

## Overview
**Adventurer Guild Manager** is a game that blends elements of Dungeons & Dragons, resource management, town simulation, and RPG mechanics. As the owner and manager of an adventurer's guild, you'll recruit and send adventurers on quests, explore dungeons, and grow your guild's reputation. The game is developed using **Unreal Engine 5** and **C++**, aiming for a mix of high performance, graphical fidelity, and a flexible development environment.

## Features
- **Guild Management:** Recruit adventurers with unique abilities using your guild's gold and reputation to form a party.
- **World Map Exploration:** Navigate a 2D world map that highlights Points of Interest (PoIs) and various dungeons. Manage travel and face random events en route to dungeons.
- **Dungeon Exploration:** Grid-based dungeon exploration with turn-based movement. Each party member has a movement range, tactical options, and can choose how to engage with dungeon rooms containing treasure, enemies, and puzzles.
- **Tactical Combat:** Face off against dungeon bosses and their henchmen in larger, strategic rooms. Utilize the terrain and party abilities for a tactical advantage in turn-based combat.
- **Progression:** Earn gold, reputation, and treasure by completing dungeons. Use these rewards to attract better talent and strengthen your guild.
- **Overarching Story:** A progressive storyline (to be developed) that ties the dungeon crawls and guild management into a cohesive adventure.
